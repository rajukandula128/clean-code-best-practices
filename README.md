# clean-code-best-practices
A collection of clean code best practices

### Why Clean Code?

````
- Cost of owning a messy code is high.
- Bad code eventually brings a product down, because during further development, productivity gradually approaches zero.
- The only way to go fast is to keep the code as clean as possible.
````

### What is Clean Code?
````
- Elegant and efficient. 
- Attempts close attention to detail.
- Simple and straight forward, to make it hard for bugs to hide.
- Readable, because reading vs write ratio is 10:1. 
- Highly expressive, that comes with meaningful names.
- Always looks like it was written by someone who cares.
- Has minimal dependencies to ease maintenance.
- Has reduced duplication.
- Complete error handling.
- Performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. 
- Express all design ideas that are in the system.
- That runs all the tests.
